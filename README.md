# Stroke-Rehabilitation-app---design-prototype
Designing a usable mobile application that helps stroke patients in their physical and psychological recovery taking usability goals into consideration.
(Design and development will get updated on basis of feedbacks throughout this semester)
Rehabilitation for a stroke is recommended to start straight away and often involves thousands of repetitions of simple tasks.  These repetitions are required to rewire (via neuroplasticity) and retrain the areas of the brain that control movement.  Unfortunately, these rehabilitation movements and tasks are boring and most stroke survivors do not do all of the exercises prescribed by their physiotherapist. so, Usability of this app is key.
